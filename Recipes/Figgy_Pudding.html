        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>Dense, moist cake reminiscent of the Victorian dessert, this figgy pudding was the perfect finale to a chestnut-stuffed, Christmas goose dinner. Serve warm with whipped cream flavored with liqueur. </p>

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <p>(makes 10 servings)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups buttermilk </li>
            <li>12 ounces dried Calimyrna figs, coarsely chopped </li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white whole-wheat flour (such as King Arthur®) </li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>3 eggs </li>
            <li>1 ½ cups dry bread crumbs </li>
            <li>½ cup butter, melted </li>
            <li>1 (2.45 ounce) package sliced almonds </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons orange marmalade </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated orange zest </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon orange-vanilla flavoring (such as Fiori di Sicilia®) (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Directions</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently heat buttermilk and figs in a saucepan over medium-low heat until softened, 10 to 15 minutes; set aside until cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube pan.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on high for 1 minute. Add fig-and-buttermilk mixture, bread crumbs, butter, almonds, orange marmalade, orange zest, and orange-vanilla flavoring to the beaten eggs; beat on low speed until blended. Gradually add flour mixture while beating until just incorporated into a batter. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Grease a sheet of aluminum foil; use to cover pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until firm and pulling away from sides of the pan, about 2 hours. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan.</li>
        </ol>
